# MRITUMORDETECTION
MRI Tumor Detection Project On Computer Vision

# Brain Tumor Detection from MRI using Computer Vision

## Project Overview
This project implements a **simple computer vision–based deep learning system** to detect brain tumors from MRI scan images. A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is used to classify MRI images into two categories: **Tumor** and **No Tumor**.

The project is designed as a **beginner-friendly academic mini project** demonstrating the application of computer vision and deep learning in healthcare.
